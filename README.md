## Issues I had
1. I'm kind of struggling piecing this together. I "get" it based on the clues (variables, functions, events, etc.) but I think that I just need to break it down further to really get it. 
2. So one of the real issues I had was with e.v. on the steps - when 3 boxes are clicked, have a button that says "start over" with an href of "#" appear somewhere on the page. I watched the videos all a few times each and still couldn't piece it together. I tried 3 or 4 different methods I found on different boards or articles with no success. Still looking for the solution.
